THE NIGHTMARE is a second layer of the world/reality that is unseen and largely
unknown to the general masses. 
	Why? 
	Only those who are extremely attuned to the
	Nightmare can even begin to percieve it/see its effects. Some are attuned enough 
	to the nightmare naturally that they are able to use the 'magic' the nightmare
	provides. 
	
	Who? 
	Roughly 1/4th of the population is acutely attuned to the nightmare enough to 
	be able to use magic. Of that 1/4th, a select few are attuned naturally even 
	further still, able to deeper understand and manipulate the magics of the 
	nightmare. Some highly attuned individuals have attempted to foray into the nightmare, 
	however there is no recorded journey into the nightmare that has resulted in 
	any sort of success, and all known individuals that have spent time in the 
	nightmare have been severely mentally altered after their experiences. 
	
	How? 
	For those that simply are able to use magic, it is currently understood that the 
	nightmare will occaisonally "ripple" in which a segment of the nightmare becomes
	temporarily intertwined with reality and paranormal events occur. Think of it as 
	the nightmare 'bleeding'. A ripple recently occurred that resulted in calamity so 
	great, a group formed advocating for the end of the use of magic, as it is belived
	by the people that the more we use magic, the more unstable the nightmare becomes.
