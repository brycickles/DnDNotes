Race: gold Dragons 
	*Rare because many of them found out about the truth of the blue eyes white dragon. With this new information, some gold dragons plotted a coux of the current religious order of the The Light, 
	however their plans were intercepted and as a result many gold dragons were killed, entirely in secret (by the church) 
	
	*Church elders covered their tracks via proclimations that most gold dragons were radical dissenters, and as a result The Light punished them for their blaspheming. 
		*Because of these statements, practicing members of The Light actively look down/shame gold dragons. 
	
	* is one of the aformentioned radicals that escaped assassination from the church. The church is, fortunately, unaware of his existence. Still, being a gold dragon, he faces the reality that he 
	sticks out like a sore thumb. 
	
	*this mass assassination happened very recently and news of it was widespread
