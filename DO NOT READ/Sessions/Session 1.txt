FOREST PATH TO VILLAGE 

	A pale female Aasimar and 7 male Dwarven miners are seen heading home. 
	They won’t stop singing and she swears it’s platonic.

	There is a tree grown and twisted that looks oddly like a warrior holding a spear. 
	The spear tip is pointing to a certain point on the ground where archaeological tools, 
	including several shovels, are stabbed into the ground. Buried six feet under 
	the ground at that spot is a chest containing a golden statue of a scorpionfox of great value. 
	The scorpionfox statue holds shovel its tail. Carved into the tree are the words 
	 “hang in there.” (This hint is a red herring.)

Further along in the adventure the party will encounter golden tentacles covering a door and blocking 
the way forward. In the middle of the tentacles is a depression in which the golden octopus statue fits. 
Placing the statue there causes the tentacles to retract and open the way forward.
