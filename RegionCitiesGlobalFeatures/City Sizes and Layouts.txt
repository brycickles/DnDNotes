Hamlet: 
	* does not appear on map 
	* no church 
	* less than 100 people
	* best anyone gets out of a hamlet is limited information and a hot meal
	* no inn, no general store, not much at all except a small gathering of 
		people trying to live off the land however they can 
Village: 
	* Cultivates their own food 
	* SMall number of farms, enough to provide for the village itself 
	* Small local govt in the form of a single noble fam that owns the village
	* Usually owned by the nearest larger settlement or nearby nobility
	* Might exist to harvest an export 
	* Some town guards - all volunteers and not well trained 
	* No realistic guard to person ration - roughly 1:50 is how i roll 
	* There is a church - religion doesnt have to make sense 
	* Likely a small shop with general goods, however this shop is designed
		to accomodate to the needs of the village and not passing 
		adventurers, so there wont be much in terms of weapons or armor
	* There will be, however, an off chance that a traveling merchant is 
		present with 2 or 3 unique items for sale. Not always relevant 
		to adventurers, however
	* There will be one dude in charge of the village, known as "The Reeve," 
		which denotes that he/she is the chief magistrate of the town
		who basically collects taxes and writes letters through a 
		personal assistant. The Reeve is not the owner of the Village, 
		however, and is appointed to be the only person in direct 
		communication with whatever entity owns the village
	 * Town populations will consist of farmers, religious workers, and 
		craftsmen who are just skilled enough to get the job done. You'll 
		be hard pressed to find a true artisan living in a village
Town: 
	* Typically a town forms after a village begins to produce a rare good
		and has an excess of it. This results in people coming in from 
		far and wide to trade... or to raid. 
	* A Town becomes a town once the population exceeds 3000 townsfolk
	* All towns are large trade centers, at LEAST and have at least ONE 
		trade route connected to the nearest large city and have typically
		several connections to other settlements via trade routes
	* Has several taverns, inns, and shops to compensate for a surplus of 
		foreigners and merchants 
	* towns recieve a wide variety of goods, such as salted meats, grains, 
		lumber, common and precious metals and ingots
	* As there is a lot of trade in Towns, there are equally as many 
		talented craftsmen. As a result, most towns have some form of 
		guild system in which artisans take on apprentices and have a 
		lot more authority than what youd find in a village
	* Typically, a corresponding guild will run the trade of any imported 
		or exported good. For instance, the guild of smiths handles 
		all trade related to metals. 
	* Governmental structure is more prominent and a far less loose system 
		of law will be implemented as too many people are running around
		at this point. In addition to the owning entity of the town and 
		its appointed overseer (reeve), the town will also have elected 
		a council of representatives. Commonly, this council will either 
		be heavily involved in trade (senior guild officials comprise the
		council) or heavily involved in the church (council comprised 
		mostly of religious elders) 
	* There are more guards as well, who are far better trained and not 
		volunteers. 
	* The presence of the church will be much larger in a town, and towns are 
		large enough where adventurers will begin to see 2, sometimes 3 
		religions represented through churches much larger than what youd 
		find in a village 
	* A note: guilds, government, and church never exist harmoniously and 
		it is expected to arrive in a town with a similar political 
		climate - when the god's will isnt heeded, when the law isnt 
		followed, or when goods are stolen these three are quick to 
		point fingers and assign blame to eachother. 
	* Layout 
		- Somewhere just beyond the Outskirts or a nearby city: a place where 
			the noble/owner of the town resides
		- Outskirts: this is where massive amounts of resources are collected
			and split up by roads that lead inside. Farms/mines are 
			common here. 
		- Further In: this is where merchants have housing, a medley of 
			inns and taverns for travelers to rest. Somewhere nearby
			to these is the trade center.
		- Trade Center: this is ran and owned exclusively by guilds, and 
			will sometimes have open market days for travelling vendors. 
			All basic needs can be met here. The number of specialists 
			is at least double compared to a village. Certain towns 
			will also offer hirelings, slaves, or even a red light 
			district 
		- Temples should be scattered about this town 
		- Center: this is where you will find town hall - this is where 
			taxes are collected and laws are written. 
		- Guards: more devoted, better paid and actuallly trained, 
			problem areas will be patrolled (such as market, tavern, 
			inns, temples, and central districts) 
City: if you packed 3 to 8 towns together, youd get a city. 
	* between 6,000 and 25,000 residents
	* these are typically the hears of kingdoms and have a wiiide offering 
		of experiences for any traveler
	* cities are comprised of layers. Everything exists in layers here.
	* in the center of the city is where the old town used to be, and 
		every time an expansion occurs, a new layer is built, which 
		also means new walls are built and the city shifts as a whole. 
		A long lived city, when viewed from above, looks like a cut 
		out treetrunk with districts showing its age. 
	* almost any good or service is available - in fact, the city is where
		we will see the most "hold" a guild can have on a governing 
		body. In cities, even perfected trade of the rarest goods is 
		available, and guilds know their true value in this stage of 
		civilization. At this point, guilds split into two major 
		groups: the merchants guild and the crafters guild, who 
		work together to monopolize their respective craft, but truly 
		it is the craftsman that rules over trade, as they set the 
		standard for the quality of good that is being traded. The 
		city is where we will begin to see things like magic shops, 
		herb shops, trinket sellers, weapons dealers, potion shops, 
		book stores, pawn shops, tailors, pet stores, jewellery shops, 
		trap crafters, toy shops, artisan blacksmiths, armor salesmen, 
		pharmacies, shitloads of cobblers and general goods
	* instead of one noble now exists a circle of lords and ladies, each 
		vying for more power than their peers 
	* cities all have their own military and guard network, and barracks
		are well established and evenly spread through the city. Just 
		like politics, guards have more power in a city and there 
		will always be enough militaristic strength on hand to wage 
		war when needed. 
	* laws are rigidly implemented, with courthouses for hearings making 
		their first appearances at this scale. In the same manner, 
		at least one well kept prison will exist. 
	* Temples/Cathedrals are massive in cities, and are most likely the 
		epicenters of their respective religions. Powerful clerics and 
		paladins collect here to pay homage to their respective gods. 
	* Massive housing districts exist to house all the commonfolk, and it
		is even common to see entirely abandoned districts home to 
		shady individuals and shadier dealings 
	
Kingdom/Nations: 
	* no longer defined by population, rather this is an interconnected 
	series of towns, villages, and cities... and hamlets technically 
	but they arent even featured on maps.
	* all settlements in this network are under one rule
	*kingdoms often led by 1 to 2 cities. 
	* one single noble rules an entire kingdom
