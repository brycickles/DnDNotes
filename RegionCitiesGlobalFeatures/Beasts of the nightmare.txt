these are colossal bigass beasts that first appeared in the world after the 
most recent calamity. They are not inherently aggressive, however they wander 
the world. Some say they look like they're searching for something. 
*These creatures are moreso weird combinations of other creatures, and then 
grown to a massive scale. An axolotlbear the size of a building, a maaaassive 
catspider wandering the elven forests, etc.
