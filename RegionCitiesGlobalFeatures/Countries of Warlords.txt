Warlord 3 Country - Desert of the Kashkouli
	This is Austins country and aesthetically has a culture resembling arabian art/ancient persia
		* A twist to this is that this is also the most technologically advanced nation of the world - they have pioneered advancements in militiristic and commercial technology through the use of stones of nightmare. 
		* Stones of nightmare are native to only Austin's lands due to a ripple that impacted that part of the world many worldphases ago. These stones are valued for their magical properties and are what makes the technology of Austins people unique and amazing. 
		* Due to the significance and scarcity of these stones, they are rarely traded out of austin's country, and any usued/broken technology is always scrapped for recycling metal with stones of nightmare reharvested for future use. While these people exist outside of the rule of the world government, very few attempt to smuggle these stones out of the Kashkouli desert out of fear of being discovered. The Kashkali will always prioritize hunting down any individuals that are known carriers of stones of nightmare. 
		* While the defining trait of this country is its massive desert, it is surrounded on 3 out of 4 sides with the Kashkouli mountains, and the remaining side being a sea border


		CITIES/FEATURES
		* Because of the sea border, several massive ports have been erected that have facilited massive amounts of trade between The Desert of the Kashkouli and the rest of the world. 
		* What is exported? 
			*country rich in iron
			*considering the possibility of opening trade of stones of nightmare (a last resort in case of economic collapse)
			*technology produced by these people is simply higher quality than the rest of the world, and as a result any of their technology, imbued with magical stone or not, is praised and sought after.
			*spices native only to Kashkouli mountains 
		*What is imported? 		
			*mostly food to feed peoples across desert colonies, theyre rather self sufficient despite living in a desert 
		*Mountain City - The only city (10,000 people) of Desert of the Kashouli, located on the western most mountain 			border. 
		*Desert colonies - there are 5 major colonies in this desert, each with their own unique property
			* colony 1: This colony is where all spices harvested from the mountains are offloaded and processed. It is located right at the base of one of the Kashkouli mountains close to the capitol city, and most individuals there earn their livings through the process of spice exporting
			* colony 2: this is an oasis smack fuck in the middle of the Kashkouli desert - nicknamed "the jewel of the world", this oasis streching roughly 100sq miles is home to the most fertile lands in the world, and is also home to the largest species of crocodileDogs in the world. Mostly farmland, however nothing is exported out of these lands, rather distributed when shortages in food occur through the country 
			* colony 3: the least 'traditional' colony. Corruption is present everywhere, and no exception is made amongs the Kashkouli peoples. If you're looking for the black market of the world, then this colony (roughly 3000 individuals live here) is for you. Rare/forbidden goods can be found here, one simply must know exactly what they're looking for before they can find what they need. 
			* colony 4: a generally smaller scale of what you'd find in the capital city - not every nook and cranny is filled with excitement, after all. 
			* colony 5: this colony stretches thinly across the entirety of the eastern sea-border. From northPort to southPort, this colony is in charge of all sea-based trading operations and is ran by a group of trade advisors to the king. 
		*Man-made features from a previous ancient civilization are constantly being uncovered and hidden across the swirling sands of the desert, and according to legends great expanses of man-made mystery await any adventurers brave enough to endure the harsh sands of the Kashkouli. 
			*interestingly, the aesthetic look of these ancient features (underground temples, massive statues buried deep, ancient massive tombs and mass graves, entire towns buried under hundreds of feet of sand, massive labarynths designed for mysterious purposes) doesnt resemble the persian aesthetic at all. Dragons are constantly depicted across the walls/sides of discovered features in the desert.  

		CULTURAL SHIT
			* Austins people are dwarves, and dwarves love beer. As a result, many of the best beers in the world are brewed in the oasis, and in many cases these best artisan beers can really only be drank if one takes a trip to the Kashkouli. Still, they import massive amounts of hops from Warlord 4 country - a land of monks versed in both fighting and agriculture - and have a healthy alliance with country 4 - nonmagic users.
			* one of the "legendary 7" restaurants of the world exists in the northPort of The Kashkouli, and is ran by an equally legendary Chef - Omar Afjshar.
				*Omar Afjshar doubles as one of the Warlord's top generals and lives an incredibly busy life. When not in times of conflict for the Ashkouli, Omar cooks legendary meals for any travelers/traders of the world to enjoy, and this is his true passion. When in times of conflict, Omar is known as "Afjshar the Merciless" and has a reputation for being an absolutely ruthless commander of the Kashkouli elite military (basically a branch of special operations command, but desert dwarves)
			* despite living in the equivalent of a semi-barren wasteland, the peoples of the Kashkouli are exceptionally vibrant, high-spirited people and are regarded as such to the rest of the world 
			* the Kashkouli are inventors of a revolutionary technology - the desert speeder. Powered by stones of nightmare, this is the Kashkouli pride and joy (desert cars in mideval fantasy, yo) and is closely kept confided to the borders of the desert. This specific technology exists nowhere else in the world, and several of the most elite military units are all equipped with desert speeders fitted with small cannons. 
				*due to this technological prowess, few (if any) now consider invasion of this land even a remote possibility. Their unwillingness to spread their technology to the rest of the world keeps this naturally militaristically overpowered race in check. 

		CURRENT POLITICAL ISSUES - 
			* Austins brother recently made the decision to ally with Warlord 5 - a magic user and an alliance frowned upon by Austin. Currently all allies of this nation are neutralist countries that do not publicly condone magic. 
				* this decision has recently caused some political unrest amongst the people of the Kashkouli
			* Because Austin's brother had such a dramatically different direction/vision for the country in mind, Brother attempted to take Austin's life through an elaborate coverup. Thought to be dead, Austin remains alive and active in the world through his adventures.
