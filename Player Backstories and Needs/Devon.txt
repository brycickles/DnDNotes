Name: Trax
Original Group/People: Circle of the moon druids
Family/Friends: 
	* ELDER ROLEMODEL/FATHERFIGURE: "Elder/leader PlaceholderName" of his circle has a deep fondness 
	for Trax and believes he is destined for greatness in some way, however
	is also disappointed in Trax for not taking religion and his role in 
	the circle seriously. 
	* MOTHERFIGURE: "Mawmaw" is the village midwife and helps raise the children of the 
	circle. She was the one to raise Trax and is the equivalent of his 
	mother. She was called away to duty when he was very young and she 
	never returned. 
		* MAYBE USE A REUNION BETWEEN THE TWO TO START THE CAMPAIGN 
		* MAWMAW is actually some form of double agent, only to be revealed 
			much later on in the story? 
		*The circle will periodically send groups of druids to scout and or 
		deal with any corruption or major problems involving nature 
		particularly with the Forrest surrounding them, and MawMaw has
		had to work in secret since Trax last saw her. Her role is 
		far greater than simply that of a circle midwife. 
	* SIBLING: Trax also has a younger sister that was left behind when Trax left the 
	village and has not seen her since. She was mastering wild shift and 
	learning restorative spells when he left. 
		*Turn her evil and pit her against the party at some point 
		as a very powerful corrupted druid. Perhaps she is the person 
		MawMaw is out to investigate, but MawMaw herself has no idea 
		that this corrupted druid is indeed Trax's sister. 
	* FATHER: Nothing is known of Trax's father (to trax) other than that he is 
	a druid from another circle. 

Notables: 
	Trax has lost his magical staff that turns into a tree and is on a quest 
	to search for it.
